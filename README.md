# The Engine of Empathy 🎙️  
Text-to-Speech System with Emotion Awareness

## Synopsis
A Python-based AI service called Empathy Engine dynamically modifies vocal characteristics in response to the text's identified emotional tone in order to transform input text into expressive speech.

Conventional text-to-speech (TTS) systems frequently have a monotonous, robotic sound. By introducing emotion-aware voice modulation, this project closes that gap and makes voice interactions more sympathetic and human-like.

## Problem Description
