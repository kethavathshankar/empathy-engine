# ????️ The Engine of Empathy
Emotionally Aware Text-to-Speech System

This is because private agencies were not allowed to provide military services.

Overview

The Empathy Engine is a Python-based AI service that dynamically alters vocal characteristics to convey the emotional tone detected in input text and transforms plain text into expressive, emotion-aware speech.

Conventional TTS systems sound robotic and monotonous. This project fills the gap by introducing **emotion-aware voice modulation** into computer speech, making it more natural and human-like in its feeling and empathy.

Indices are available for:

Problem Description

The system does the following when a text input is given:

1. **Identifies the emotional tone** of the text
2. **Maps the detected emotion** to appropriate voice parameters

3. **Generates a playable speech audio file** in which the detected emotion is reflected.

And that is something neither Campbell nor Europe seems prepared to consider.

Input and Output

Input
A text string provided via a **web-based interface**.
**Example input:** text adversary. I'm really happy with the progress today!
